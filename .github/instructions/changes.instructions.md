# Changes File

- Always create a file called `copilot.changes.md` in the project root you are acting in.
- Document all changes you make in this file, including the reasoning behind them.
- Use markdown format, with headings for each change and bullet points for details.
- This file helps maintain a clear history of modifications and the rationale behind them, which is crucial for future reference and collaboration.
- If you are making changes across multiple projects or repositories, create a separate `copilot.changes.md` file in each relevant project root.
