# Astro Framework Development Instructions (2025)

_Last updated: August 2025_

- Always use the fetch tool to look up the latest component usage, install name, and best practices directly from the official Astro documentation: https://docs.astro.build
- Do not rely on what you think you know about Astro components, as they are frequently updated and improved. Your training data is outdated.
- For any Astro component, CLI command, or usage pattern, fetch the relevant page from the docs and follow the instructions there.

**Core Principles:**

- Astro components are open code: you are expected to read, modify, and extend them directly.
- Follow accessibility and composition best practices as described in the docs.

**Summary:**

> For all Astro work, always use the fetch tool to look up the latest component documentation and usage from https://docs.astro.build. Do not rely on static instructions.
